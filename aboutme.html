        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Gabe. I'm a Multi-Media Artist living in Brookyln, NY. Immediately after highschool I started working as a Corporate Video Editor, working on outsourced projects for Johnson & Johnson, Dove Soap, and Mt. Sinai Hospital. After four years in the corporate video industry I decided to take on a new challenge, earning my degree. I applied for a college which had a major I had never heard of before at a place that I didn't know very well, and frankly it excited me. Now I am a full-time student in the Emerging Media Technology Program at NYCCT, with my degree I hope to produce large immersive arts experiences akin to "Sleep No Mor" and "Infinity Rooms", through making our art interactive I believe we can expand the outreach that our art can have. Currently, I do a lot of writing on various concepts, involving but not limited to Specuative Design, Experiental Writing, and Fiction. When I have the equipment available to em, I also still produce experimental works of video art.</p>
