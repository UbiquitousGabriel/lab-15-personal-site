        <h2>Applications of Speculative Design and Emerging Media</h2>
        <h4>By Gabriel Aguilar</h4>
        <h5>November 14, 2023</h5>
        <p>People look down at the same device day after day, complaining about information stolen, privacy lost, and discomfort in the way that they interface with technology. Little do they know that the advancement and emergence of new and existing technology can be extremely beneficial to their lives as a whole. Let’s make these big amorphous tech concepts a little less daunting, and bring them back in the loop.</p>
        <p>Joe Popelas, currently a millionaire at the age of 23, was a 20-year-old high school graduate working a dead-end job to make ends meet. That was until he discovered CHATGPT, a self-reflective repository of the internet’s best and worst sources up until a month prior to your access time, or as some would call it an “AI”. Many people don’t understand what these new “AI” programs actually are, and in order to understand speculative design, emergent technology, and advancements in machine learning in 2023, it’s important to actually understand what this program is. </p>
        <p>So let’s break it down, try to think of an “artificial intelligence” as a folder within your desktop, in the case of CHATGPT, it has every publicly accessible piece of information on the internet stored within it up until this year. What makes CHATGPT so useful are two of its features, its language model, and the fact that it can self-reflect. A language model within computing is a way to interface with a program using natural human language, so instead of typing keywords and hoping, you can articulate a sentence and establish a tone that the program can understand better over time. Whereas, self-reflection within a program is something a lot of us use daily. A great example is pressing “CTRL+F” on a keyboard to search a document for keywords. What CHATGPT does, is take the prompt that you as the user provided and searches its repository for information related to your prompt, and then displays the found research back to you in a syntax formulated to imitate your own.</p>
        <p>Now that you understand at a base level what CHATGPT is actually doing, you can begin to understand where some of the ideas that it is putting out are coming from. A combination of the user’s syntax and prompt with information from its repository. It’s not necessarily making anything new, it is a new type of keyboard and search engine, and those results that it is popping out are just a new way of concatenating the information together. This is how Joe Popelas who was mentioned earlier was able to make millions by co-publishing books with CHATGPT. Popelas took his ideas for novels, entered them into the program, and asked for CHATGPT to expound upon them. Then by repeating the process over and over through the use of linked prompts, he is able to develop novels in a much shorter amount of time, as it uses previously established works of literature and writing to create variations on the user’s inputs. What really makes Joe Popelas’s generative technique so reliable is his prompt generation, organization, and syntax.</p>
        <p>Joe Popelas has already used the newly emerged technology known as CHATGPT to make waves in the publishing and business industries. Whereas the Pink Chicken Project attempts to take a recently emerged technology relating to the fields of genetics and paleontology to turn the remnants of biological fossils pink. While this isn’t the most practical use of the technology, this design-based artistic endeavor is designed to make us think about the implications of the path we lead, and what we leave behind, by literally coloring it pink. This project remains a favorite of mine due to the nature of its design. Not only does it, embody what speculative design is, but it also embodies what it can do for us. </p>
        <p>	The Pink Chicken Project allows reflection on an important topic and thus serves its purpose as a piece of speculative design artwork. While older fossils mark the stages of biological life on our planet, currently the best way to note humans within our geological layers is by our waste. This project proposes that by making the fossils of the chickens that we kill pink we may be able to track the history of our current age in the far future. “Being the world's most common bird, the bones of the 60 billion chickens that are killed every year leave a distinct trace in the rock strata (the earth's crust), a marker for the new geological age - the Anthropocene.” - The Pink Chicken Project Website. </p>
        <p>This particular process would be done by modifying the genome of a chicken using the recently invented Gene Drive Technology, a technology that has come from CRISPR research, and then allowing humans to do what modern humans seem to do best, consume at a rapid pace. This would leave a trace within the ground beneath us, a fossil record notating the mark of the Anthropocene era and how long it lasted. While the concept may seem farfetched, the implication of the project would actually be quite simple, just as we are already breeding chickens for favorable attributes, we could spread the gene for pink fossilized bones both in large-scale facilities and small. Breeding and its applications are even taught at a middle school level, often by using this experiment in which students create glow-in-the-dark flies.</p>
        <p>Then, to add on to their process should humans ever stop using chickens as a primary source of sustenance we could apply similar marking biology to what we consume in the future. One such example is Meydan Levy’s “Neo_Fruits”, a concept for an “Artificially designed fruit printed in 4 dimensions.” This particular design focuses on the nature of human consumption and the impacts that fruit has had on society as a whole. Using this method of 4D printing, an application of 3D printing technology in which a printed item can change form and expand when influenced by some form of energy, humans could cut down on waste, and when combined with the Pink Chicken Project’s Design we could see how and when the change from mass-farming to printed fruit and organics became standardized within human culture and society.</p>
        <p>Now you see just some of the ways that speculative design and emerging media can assist you in your daily life. Hopefully, knowing about these technologies' applications and the speculative future allows you some ease of mind when thinking about your current interactions with technology and the inevitable integration of it within the most basic aspects of your everyday life. Through understanding more about us and the effect that we have on the world we were able to understand speculative design’s possible impact on our understanding of history and beyond. When taking a closer look at the mechanics of what makes an artificial intelligence we came to the conclusion that by automating simple tasks that may be lengthy or draining on a human we can improve our workflow and rate of advancement within a professional setting. These new topics are incredibly exciting to me, and hopefully, this essay has made you excited about them too.</p>

        <h2>Ethnography Manchester:</h2>
        <h3>By Gabriel Aguilar</h3>
        <h4>March 8th, 2023</h4>
        <p>Day 1: The train was delayed again. As was common during my travels throughout the UK and on this particular trip, my first trip, my first impression. Evidently, the train workers are paid next to nothing in the UK and as they should, even if it inconvenienced both the public and I, a foreign traveler, went on strike in order to remedy their lack of compensation. The struggle from what I understood was not exactly going as well as it should have.</p>
        <p>Little progress was made and the general public started to turn against the workers instead of the rail companies. While at first, these protesters had the support of most, after a while, the public had decided that their discomfort was more of a hardship than the livelihoods of the workers. After about an hour of the train being delayed, I received a notification that the line was canceled without a refund. </p>
        <p>Ordinarily, this was something I would have allowed myself to be frustrated over, however, in this particular scenario, I only had time to attempt to book the second-to-last train of the night. </p>
        <p>Hurrying my way through my recently broken phone, I looked at what tickets I could get from this strange connecting station just outside of my destination, Manchester. It seemed as if I only had one, fairly expensive, and ill-timed train. So I booked my seat, hoofed it to a parallel track, and waited another hour for my ride to arrive. It only took around forty-five minutes for the steel bullet to come, however, in that time, I had seen plenty of odd characters: a woman eating some strange variation of a sausage roll behind blue-tinted glass, a man anxiously watching as a reached into my bag for some of my “Cool American” Doritos, and a large gaggle of soccer fans, emerging from a train celebrating the win of their favorite team, chanting some strange incantation that proceeded them all running into the bathrooms together to do whatever it is that testosterone-filled potbelly tuckers do when alone.</p>
        <p>Time passed slowly as I listened to the yodels and chants grow further and further away. I waited for my train to arrive and it did show up, only around fifteen minutes late. But by this point, I had already been delayed for quite some time. Boarding the train, I got into my assigned seat notated by a red light and words somewhat akin to “occupied” or “sold”. Putting on my headphones to drown out the noise of others on various phone calls and conversations, I began to read a book I had bought during my not-so-brief time in Edinburgh. </p>
        <p>Located to my left was a young Irish or Scottish woman, the distinction still being a hard one for me to discern after a month in the UK. She had red hair and was wearing a faux leather jacket adorned with cheap chains. Similarly, she delved into a book, though the contents were unimportant to my mind then. Noticing my gaze she smiled, I smiled, and we exchanged a few words about where we were from, where we were traveling, etc. A classic train affair, an engagement of two strangers for just a brief moment when being hurdled by a metal canister to a shared destination. </p>
        <p>“Tickets please,” the operator called out as he went down the aisle of the train. Seemingly the woman I had been talking to began to get on edge and as the ticket man arrived there was a short explanation of the reasoning behind her not having a ticket. The man seemed amicable and allowed her to purchase the ticket on the train, a great nicety, due to this not usually being a possibility. As opposed to the trains in the Northeast of America, which I have grown quite accustomed to over the last ten years of frequent travel between New York City and Pennsylvania, these tracks were filled with smiles and polite conversations. It made me feel easy, as if the cares of being delayed had been dampened by a warm washcloth. </p>
        <p>Time progressed on these lazy tracks, and between the company of a brief encounter and my book, we arrived in Manchester before too long. The train comes to a stop, I collect my lonely small backpack filled with all of my luggage for the month and a half across the sea, and I quickly retreat the train before it moves on to the next destination. Before me, Manchester Victoria Station was a strange mix between modern architecture and classical British buildings. Above, a grand sweeping plastic cover keeps rain from drenching the civilians below as the buildings under house various shops, which are at this time of night, long closed. </p>
        <p>Reaching into my pocket, I began walking my way to my friend's dorm room, a journey that took me much longer than I expected. Rain covered my waterproof jacket and soaked my backpack in the UK skies particular brand of punishment. Passing through this city it seemed very urban and industrial in its layout. It reminded me of my home in a lot of ways, perhaps a mix of Wall Street Manhattan, Jay Street, and various locations in Queens that do not come to my mind immediately. Crossing a dark bridge in the middle of the night overlooking a river that was as black as the sky above it, I couldn’t help but notice how much nicer the air was here when juxtaposed to my home back in the USA. </p>
        <p>After a bit more time admiring the city during my rainy walk, I managed to arrive at my friend’s dorm on the outskirts of Manchester, about a two mile walk from the city center. When I called him on the phone, he lazily made his way down to see me, as if he had been caught off guard by my sudden appearance. It turns out, however, this was just his pace, a source of occasional contention within the group we had traveled with previously. Warmly, and with a flair as is common amongst actors, he greeted me with a hug and the familiar scent of his heater-like torso.</p>
        <p>He led me upstairs as we discussed various aspects of our lives, caught up with each other, and discussed marching orders for the night in front of us. The cities in the UK always have a bar open, and the residents frequent them with a passion. Taking a seat in his living room, a dull white room lit by overhead hospital lights, the floor and countertops covered in beer cans, rose tequila, and a strange sweet diabetes-inducing liqueur that was meant to taste like smores, we decided on a bar that we would go to. </p>
        <p>Joined by his friend, a particularly loud and passionate speaker, energized by the fact that there was an American in his presence, we made our way down to the cab that was waiting for us outside. Josh, the friend who had invited me, expectantly made us run late for our pickup. Luckily the driver was at ease with waiting. We made our way into the center of the city, to a local rock bar that was filled with all sorts and sizes of people. We waited in line for permission to be let in and eventually, after almost having to bribe our way, we landed within the bar. Surrounded by neon lights and a tunnel that beckoned us onto a dance floor, playing music from the American Rock scene, I grew particularly fond of its seedy nature and denizens that hollered my music with accents that made it almost incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>The night progressed with singing, dancing, and guiding Josh through the dancefloor in an attempt to assist him to see through the dim area, as he has no light receptors in his eyes to reflect what little light there was in this place. Josh, ever the social butterfly, made friends, enemies, and the occasional brief lover throughout the night. Time wasn’t present within this place, it was merely a cocoon for degeneracy and behavior that shouldn’t be spoken of outside of the doors that allowed us this sanctuary. Eventually, however, when Josh had found a girl that seemed to latch on like a leech, we made our way outside of the venue, his other friend and I laughing at the ridiculousness of Josh’s charisma and lack of embarrassment over having his face sucked halfway down the stairs.</p>
        <p>We sat at a local wing shop, enjoying the “chicken and chips” as we attempted to fill our mouths with water and food to avoid hangovers in the morning. Lazily, we made our way back to the dorm, calling an uber that we were, predictably, very late for. The night was over and Josh and I attempted to share his dorm bed without too much cuddling between us, but we are artists and queers and the usual masculine boundaries don’t apply to us. We are above the fear of being perceived as homosexual and as such a warm body means nothing more than a comfort in a cozy room with LED lights: The two of us inherited the night's embrace as we fell into a drunken slumber.</p>
        <p>Day 2: Two men woke as a pretzel, the sunlight streaming in through trashy curtains made of plastic, warmth filling the bed with a sublayer of sweat from heated slumbering bodies. Sitting up, we discussed the day. Josh had a class and though he had attempted to have me join him, the professors were understandably wary. Clothes were donned, a backpack was strapped to my back, and friends left the apartment heading toward different parts of the city. First, however, as the clothes on my back were in need of washing, a laundromat was inevitable. I walked through the outskirts towards a mall shop run by a Russian family, who were nice enough to let me start my wash while I collected cash from a local ATM.</p>
        <p>Briefly encountering a grocery store, I purchased a meal deal for breakfast, a simple combination of food that were sold as a package deal for a cheap price. These became an invaluable part of my trip as I was on a very tight budget. Gobbling down my BLT, two hardboiled eggs, and Lucozade, I withdrew cash, headed back to the Laundromat, and received my clothing, which I promptly rolled and placed back in my backpack. Though my back was getting stronger over the trip, I couldn’t help but think that the backpack was getting heavier as the days went on.</p>
        <p>Before leaving, I waited just a little bit to observe the Russian family in their dominion. Their cousins accidentally called the women fat, the husband facepalmed, and the strong-minded grandmother fiercely reprimanded her kin. It was amusing, a nice taste of their life as I bid them ado. As I walked past the local corner store to pick up some deodorant it took me by surprise that more than likely I would never see those people again, in fact, I wouldn’t see many of the people I had met on my travels.</p>
        <p>More walking, passing by new yet familiar places, a tavern called the Black Friar, a car dealership, and a highway that seemed endless, without a way to get across. Eventually, a reprieve settled in as my camera snapped pictures all along. A brief intersection lit by green lights and walking men symbols showed me the way. So I followed, making my way uphill toward the center city.</p>
        <p>Arriving, I was greeted by more shopping centers than I knew what to do with, a never-ending parade of commerce, mostly marked by big brands and expensive wares. This was not where I chose to call my place for the day, so I continued adventuring, past the rail lines adorned by Yellow Cars and the people who chose to ride them, past the shopping centers, past the group of petitioners paid by a larger corporation to smile and get signatures. </p>
        <p>A fairly famous church was explored, as well as the outside of a museum dedicated to football, a sport which I get the appeal of but could not be bothered with watching a game. A statue of a queen cast in bronze sat within a park that had recently been renovated as a venue. She was lonely and yet domineering; she had no interest as I walked by. I made my way back to the petitioners. One of them had actually seemed quite nice so I struck up a conversation, one that left me with new eyes set on the Northern Quarter. </p>
        <p>It is here where I found a true love for the city. Huddled behind shopping centers, enormous wealth, and artificial play-lands for adults was a location very similar to the bar from the night before, covered in people wearing strange clothes, marked by a unique sense of fashion and inspiration from the alternative rock scene and thrifting. These streets were home to the outliers, the people who didn’t quite fit in amongst the generic streets I had begun to think Manchester was in its entirety. No, industrialism was only a part of this city; this place had a new culture, one I felt at home with. </p>
        <p>A few places were recommended to me, a comic shop filled with all flavors, from queers and dorks alike. They liked my knowledge of various geeky subjects and led me from one hotspot to another. That’s when it came into my world: Affleck’s— the Holy Grail of alternative culture within the Northern Quarter. A shopping center filled with shops that were constantly changing, small endeavors led by unique people, led by emerging artists, purveyors of odd goods, and fashion-forward thinkers. My stride hastened as I filled my eyes and hands with the various textiles, curiosities, and knickknacks.</p>
        <p>The shops though very small varied greatly from one another. In one corner a lingerie shop for fans of gothic fashion, and in another corner a cafe with young women dressed as maids. The shops were dynamic and numerous to an extent that I felt I could get lost within them, and occasionally I did. Though getting lost led me to greater discoveries, a group of young artists who had just purchased a new plot within this place hoped to sell homemade textiles. They were incredibly friendly and we chatted about the state of art in our various cities, it was enriching, and had I had another day I would have spent hours talking and helping them set up their shop.</p>
        <p>A brief purchase as a thank you for their time and I continued on my way through the center, trying to absorb all that I could and even harder, to experience it when the time was not on my side. Eventually, these winding paths and storefronts came to an end and I was left drained, sitting on the stoop outside and glancing at a nearby bar that would eventually be the place where Josh and I met up after his day at school. Making my way over I waited, downing the pints they delivered posthaste and listening to a mix of Cuban music and American Rap. This music was new to me, but I enjoyed it as I waited and after a bit of time, I was met by my friend. He was sweaty and stinky from a long day of classes and a long walk over.</p>
        <p>We had both had a long day and before long we were back in his dorm, drenched and exhausted from the day's events. Tonight was not the night for a party, it was for recovery, for relaxation. As is common amongst people nowadays Josh began to delve into a weed brownie and though I had bad experiences in the past with pot I joined him. The results were not relaxing.</p>
        <p>The night after that was dark, filled with panic attacks and a mental state I was sure I would not escape from. Josh helped me through all of them, reassuring me of his medical training, if anything actually went wrong he would save me. I clutched his bedsheets as I tried to sleep as the world turned and the paranoia set in. Not so humbly waiting for my upcoming death, it was sure to come as my heart was racing and on multiple occasions, I seemed to remember a book my grandmother had read me when I was smaller about these symptoms. This book had been a recurring hallucination in the past when I had tried pot, but I could not rationalize it. That is what a negative mindset can do to you. Eventually, after exhausting myself with various methods, cold water, shaking in the bathroom, and merely glimpsing into my own mortality I fell asleep. The night graced me with her presence, she saved me from my mind.</p>

        <h2>Bad Kids, or Rascals?</h2>
        <h3>By Gabriel Aguilar</h3>
        <h4>September 19th, 2023</h4>
        <p>“Every teenager is a shitty fucking person.” said my uncle and mother at least thirty separate times in my life. This is what I had always been taught growing up. It was my family's way of diminishing the atrocities performed by almost every teenager on almost every occasion. This simple answer provided them, and me, an out when I was a kid. Even to this day I still use it when comforting teens and “tweens” at the coed sleepaway camp where I work. This phrase is incredibly useful when they are blaming themselves for their own actions, or when they say things like “I don’t understand why is ______ so mean?!” under a sea of hormone-driven tears. However, that mindset, the literal interpretation of that message I had been taught changed the day the counselors had to meet about “The Rascals”.</p>
        <p>The Poconos, a legendary vacation spot in Pennsylvania, isn’t actually always the gentlest place in regards to the weather, but this first story takes place before the rainstorms came in for the summer. On an abnormally bright day in June of 2019, smiling 20-somethings piled into Shield’s Hall, a basketball court, and auditorium built for the needs of a summer camp, an incredibly versatile place that makes absolutely no sense when you see it in person. Up above the wooden benches that we were instructed to pull out ourselves, you can see banners the size of a small car lining the ceiling, left up in celebration of a camp event called “Color War” that happens every year, and this camp had been doing this event since 1939, which if you can’t visualize is a lot of fucking banners. One notable one is the banner of Gary Shields dressed up as Robin Hood, another celebration of the camp legend whom “The Hall” was named after. </p>
        <p>As the counselors began to build themselves rows with the trashy, gum-covered wooden benches we could feel the excitement in the air, everybody was waiting for another awesome speech by Brian Leahy, the boy's side Camp Director. Around camp, this guy is royalty, when he gives compliments you can see the hardest men turn to mush. People were always excited to hear Brian talk, his magnetic energy practically filled the room, and all you could do was listen. In this particular speech, Brian explained why he uses the term “Rascals” about kids who are misbehaving or are troubled. He says that taking phrases like “bad kid” out of your mouth and head can actually improve your mindset quite a bit as a childcare provider, and I absolutely agree. Taking negative thoughts about children and reducing them to silly words like rascal is absolutely beneficial to your personal mindset and can improve how you perceive young ones.</p>
        <p>Brian had given speeches in the past, from a snake biting him while he was supervising a preschool playground and shouting “Fiddlydee!”, to creating a whole ceremony to sacrifice the candy given by parents after visiting day. It’s just that this one had a certain draw on me, something that really spoke to my inner troubled youth. When he stood up there and taught me that no matter what the child did, they were just acting on instinct, something truly resonated with me. I remembered making decisions at sixteen and younger that I would never make today, such as longboarding down mountains without safety equipment, breaking into abandoned buildings, and taking swigs of vodka in the bathroom at school for a kick of adrenaline. These stupid decisions aren’t who I am now, and upon reflection, I don’t believe those decisions were who I was.</p>
        <p>At the end of my summer in 2019 I was promoted to the position of Division Head. This meant that not only did I have to watch over my bunk of rascals, but I was also directly responsible for the other two bunks within my division. Over the course of camp, I remember how that mindset that Brian instilled in us, began to fade. Admittedly, after wearing myself out over the course of the summer, mine did too. It wasn’t easy having to manage the emotions of thirty-six children and sixteen adults. I’ll never forget on the last day of camp, when I walked into my bunk only to hear the counselors talking poorly about the kids, not remotely constructively, I was uncomfortable, I was hurt, and worst of all, if they had felt like this the entire time, I hadn’t done my job properly. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, I remember waking up that night at around 12 a.m., I had decided to let the kids pull an all-nighter, a special gift on the last night of camp. I would never make this decision now but I was new and some of the counsellors who had been former campers convinced me that it would be fine. Unfortunately, I had been taking Benadryl due to the massive sinus infection that I had at the time, and therefore, could not stay up to supervise. Eventually, I was woken up by my counselor Charlie, and he informed me that one of my campers had run out of the cabin crying. Making my way outside groggily, it was in my best interest to find the kid as quickly as possible. When I did, he was outside sitting on a rock in full tears, and when I spoke to the child he told me some pretty harrowing things about how he viewed himself, and what he wanted to do to himself. </p>
        <p>Immediately after he told me this, I picked up my walkie-talkie and radioed for Brian. Dealing with ideations as negative as what had just been expressed to me was far outside of my purview, but I sat there and watched until Brian came over. It turns out that some of the kids in the bunk had been bullying him all summer, and on the last night of camp it had gotten to the point where the boy couldn’t hold it in anymore. This particular scenario reinforced my understanding of Brian’s speech. Not only had I assumed that this kid was the bully of the division due to past actions, but I hadn’t considered why he was behaving the way he was, and as it turns out, his bullying was reactionary. It was one of the hardest lessons I’ve ever had to learn, and I had to learn it to the detriment of another human being. Eventually, we resolved the situation, putting the entire division to bed. That’s when I explained the situation to Brian fully, and after hearing that I had allowed the sleepover to happen, he said to me plainly “You reap what you sow.” That sentence was my takeaway from the entire summer, but it served me well, a I came back the next summer with a fire lit in me, I needed to do better, by myself, by the kids, and by my staff.</p>
        <p>As I got better at my position at camp, these last nights were mitigated year after year. While they still aren’t perfect, I can say that instead of calling the campers bad, my counselors now say rascal. My counselors, who had gone through the situation the summer before, now search for the real issue and prevent these situations from happening preemptively. Even if they sometimes refer to the camper’s time away at camp as "The Reset” when the campers go back to their old lives and receive all of that negative outside influence, and we are left the next year, reteaching them the same concepts over and over again. I suppose it’s fun, that trial and error, allowing myself to make mistakes, knowing that at the end of the summer, the kids will be fine, and by the next summer I will be able to make the lessons I teach better, more effective. Hopefully, those lessons will stick one of these years, and my campers and counselors will be better for them.</p>
        <p>Growing up is just one of those things, we all do it, and most of us do it poorly, and that’s okay. Other “things” that fall into that category, in my belief, are first loves, first jobs, arguments with parental figures, escaping the nest, and for a majority of us, a major loss. Doing things poorly is part of the human condition, a concept we are plagued with, and for that reason, it's a topic we are immensely intrigued with, to the point where, I, an undergrad with a relatively minuscule lifelong experience, feel comfortable talking about it so casually. When we do these things poorly, we choose to give ourselves the out of “Oh well nobody does it smoothly”, and while that is accurate, it is also why Brian’s mindset on “Rascals” holds so true.</p>

        <h2>Cocoa</h2>
        <h3>By Gabriel Aguilar</h3>
        <p>Do I take another sip of this day-old hot cocoa,</p>
        <p>Just to never forget the taste.</p>
        <p>Trying to hold onto that warm feeling that disappears within hours.</p>
        <p>Another sip, a stale memory of the heat and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>=========</p>
        <p>Do I set the cocoa down,</p>
        <p>To make another batch.</p>
        <p>Leaving the old one behind.</p>
        <p>=========</p>
        <p>The fire pit is barely lit.</p>
        <p>I haven’t put in more wood in far too long.</p>
        <p>So I sit.</p>
        <p>In a cold room, staring at the embers.</p>
        <p>Allowing that cold wet snow to seep in through the back door screen.</p>
        <p>=========</p>
        <p>It’s calming, this breeze.</p>
        <p>A cool wind and a cool mind taking my last sip of stale cocoa.</p>
        <p>The warmth has gone, along with the light.</p>
        <p>Yet, here I am still just trying to fight.</p>
        <p>=========</p>
        <p>This feeling.</p>
        <p>This ever-growing feeling of the world shrinking.</p>
        <p>The world around me getting smaller and smaller.</p>
        <p>And my vision getting more focused.</p>
        <p>I feel dizzy but I don’t stop.</p>
        <p>This dark cloud from floating in.</p>
        <p>Seeping into my every thought.</p>
        <p>=========</p>
        <p>I search for a light.</p>
        <p>I search for some warmth.</p>
        <p>And then I see it.</p>
        <p>Where there once was flame there is now ash.</p>
        <p>Yet when I dig, there is still some left.</p>
        <p>I walk over to feel that small amount of satisfaction.</p>
